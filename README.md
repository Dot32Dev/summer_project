# Summer project
## Build instructions
Download glew, glfw, and glm from their releases, and place them into a folder 
called libraries. Inside of libraries, create a folder called stb_image, and 
place stb_image.h in there. Copy glfw3.dll and glew32.dll to be next to the 
main.cpp file. Then open the visual studio solution and compile.
